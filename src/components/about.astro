        <p>Hi, I'm Peter â€” a <b>Software Engineer</b> with 2+ years of experience building scalable, high-performance web applications.</p>
        
        <p>I specialize in full-stack development with <b>React, Node.js, TypeScript, and MongoDB,</b> enjoy crafting clean, maintainable code that solves real-world problems.</p>
          
        <p>From building responsive UIs with Tailwind CSS to designing robust RESTful APIs and MVC-based back-ends, I take pride in delivering end-to-end solutions that are both efficient and user-focused.</p>
          
        <p>Outside of work, I enjoy contributing to side projects, sharing knowledge, and exploring the latest in software architecture and developer tooling.</p>

        <p>Check out my work on <a href={app.links.github} target="_blank"><span class="text-accent font-bold">GitHub</span></a> ðŸš€.</p>
